    <h3>How to be Plastic</h3>
    <p> On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was. It’s October third.</p>

    <p> Cady Heron’s first Homecoming Dance is only a couple of days away and she
    did not leave the south side to go to the dance stag. Karen has ESPN or something,
    but she can’t figure out who Aaron really wants to go to the dance with and even
    though Cady has really bad breath in the morning, she still might have a shot at
    scoring a date with him. Grool.</p>

    <p> Regina George can’t help that she’s so popular but she hasn’t managed to
    win over Aaron’s heart, yet. On the next page, Cady and Regina will have to race
    after Aaron to win his love. Press <span class="black">“z”</span> to move Cady
    across the screen and <span class="black">“&rarr;”</span> to move Regina. Stop
    trying to make fetch happen and get yourself a date or else you can't sit with
    us! Just remember, don’t have sex, because you will get pregnant and die.</p>

    <p><span class="right"> You go, Glenn Coco.</span></p>
